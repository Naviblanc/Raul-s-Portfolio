                    The purpose of this project was to be our first exposure to web development. Our professor made us choose a specific wikipedia page to which we would replicate as we go through the web development subject.

                   The character that I have chosen at the time was Tails Prowess. I chose this wikipedia page because it did not have a lot of elements within it and mainly consists of paragraphs.

                The project gave us fundamental learnings on how to use basic HTML and CSS programming and processes such as divs and columns as shown in the photo above with the blue bar.
